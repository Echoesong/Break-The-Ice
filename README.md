# ðŸ§ŠðŸ¥Š Break the Ice

Break the Ice brings together a collection of questions that help visitors learn more about each other and themselves. Inspired by the questions of the day that we answer as a cohort (thanks Zakariah!), our app allows users to track lifeâ€™s most interesting, random, and fun details.

# Getting Started

Link to the app: [Break the Ice](https://ancient-springs-28484.herokuapp.com/icebreakers) 

Link to the planning board: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/chzCQkuT/project-2)

Break the Ice opens with an index page showing all the icebreaker-style questions that users have submitted, ordered by topic and the number of responses. Each icebreaker includes a link to a detail page where users can view all the responses submitted for that question. 

On each detail page, users can also delete the icebreaker, submit a response, delete a response, or edit a response. The user also has the option to edit the icebreaker, but only if there have been no answers submitted. 

# Next Steps

- Incorporate OAuth so that only logged in users can add questions and answers. And so that only the user who added a question or answer can edit or delete it. 
- Include a detail page for a user that lists all the responses they have submitted. 
- Incorporate like or favorite functionality, and include liked questions/ responses on a user's favorites page. 
- Allow users to click a topic and see an index page with only questions relating to that topic. 
- Include a submission language filter to screen for profanity.
